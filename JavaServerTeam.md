# intro

THe hackathon was a really interesting experience because most hackathons are done by 
mostly people in intermediat to expert level. THis hackathan was less of competition 
but more of a leanrend experience. It was the process of creating a server form nothing 
that taughted us so much. YOu can learn a ton in a class room but how to apply it in the real
world not one of them. 

At first we did our own individual research and learned a little about building a java server that
can do data processing. Our first real task was to turn a server localy in our computer and to do that 
we had to learn Wamp Server for windows and Go through the terminal in mac. We had to add and remove certain lins
of code to get to point to an html file. At first it didn't work but by going through the terminal and 
wamp server we were able to turn that into our own server.

Once we had achieved that our objective was to incorporate the spring framework so that we actually utitilize
the server we created to actually do data processing. In order to install the spring fraework we had to learn
how to use Gradle which is a thrid party tool kit. We struggled with for about an hour untill Kevia showed us homebrew
and homebrew took care of gradle for us. Then the issue was getting gradle to work with java. Unfortunatley we exhausted our 
limits of understanding because writing stuff in the terminal is so different then writing in from a normal java IDE.

If we could fully build gradle and setup the spring framework, than we'd be in the posistion and process the data and make sense of it 
and use it in a language like R. Unfortunatly we didn't get to that step since the gradle step is finished. But luckily 
that is not nessasary to develope the minimum viable product. Our goal was a seconday and is not nessasary for the actual
functioning of the app. As of now it looks like Gradle is having trouble finding a main to run with.
