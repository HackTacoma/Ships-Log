# intro

THe hackathon was a really interesting experience because most hackathons are done by 
mostly people in intermediat to expert level. THis hackathan was less of competition 
but more of a leanrend experience. It was the process of creating a server form nothing 
that taughted us so much. YOu can learn a ton in a class room but how to apply it in the real
world not one of them.
