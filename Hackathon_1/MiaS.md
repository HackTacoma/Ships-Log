#Intro

##We are 30 minutes away from working for 12 hours straight. Wow!

###So Far:
 - Went to Winco to buy groceries at 2:00AM
 - Baked bagel bites at 3:00AM
 - Made Blueberry Pancakes (from scratch), Bacon, and Eggs at 6:30AM. Fed 10 people
 - Picked up Coffee from Evergreen at 7:45AM. THANK YOU EVERGREEN! 
 
##All is coming together very nicely :)

#End of the event --

##It is 21:06 and we are celebrating the success! We cooked lunch as scheduled after we all took an hour break. At 20:00 we made dinner - Lasagna and Salad w/ Breadstix. Us cooks have definitely pulled through the whole day, as well as the developers. It was challenging, yet rewarding. All of us connected right off the bat and we all felt comfortable with one another. We completed our duties earlier than scheduled, and I am amazed at how much everyone was commited! Can't wait for the next Hackathon event! 

#Time for ZZZZ
