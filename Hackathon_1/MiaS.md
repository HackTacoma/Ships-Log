#Intro :panda_face:

##The cooking department was given $250 to buy groceries for the whole event. Siera and I came together and made out a meal plan that will feed the whole team, 10 people, yet staying within budget. We decided to make Bagel Bites, Pancakes with Eggs and Bacon, Teriyaki Chicken with Rice, and Lasagna with Salad & Breadstix. I will keep all of the receipts to calculate the total amount spent after we go grocery shopping. I already spent $50 at Costco Friday evening to buy the little things needed, so we have about $200 left to spend. I believe this will be enough to cover the food costs.

##We are 30 minutes away from working for 12 hours straight. Wow!

###So Far:
 - Went to Winco to buy groceries at 0200
 - Baked bagel bites at 0300
 - Made Blueberry Pancakes (from scratch), Bacon, and Eggs at 0630. Fed 10 people. Had leftovers.
 - Picked up Coffee from Evergreen at 7:45AM. THANK YOU EVERGREEN! 
 - Maggie picked up :doughnut::doughnut: Perfect with the fresh hot :coffee:
 
##All is coming together very nicely :)

###Update:
 - We all took an hour break and some of us went to Point Ruston to catch a breather. When we came back it was almost time for lunch
 - At 1200 Sierra started pre-making the postickers
 - Served lunch at 1300; Potstickers, Teriyaki Chx Rice Bowls -- No leftovers!
 - At 1400 everyone went back to coding after eating lunch together. Sierra and I cleaned up and took a break.

###Update:
 - Prepped the Pepperoni Lasagna at 1900 and cooked it at 2000. Served with a side salad and Breadtix - There were leftovers
 - Everyone had dinner together and it was a nice break
 - Cleaned up the kitchen and started to pre close.. Wow, the last half went by pretty quick. 
 
#End of the event --

#Afterthoughts:
 - I learned a lot at the Hackathon event. I can say I am truly proud of myself and everyone for pulling through. I'm sure all of us, both cooks and developers, agree it was challenging, yet rewarding. It was a 24 hour scheduled event but the developers really worked hard with one another, putting in 100%, and completed the task earlier than scheduled. All of us connected right off the bat and we all felt comfortable with eachother. I am amazed at how much everyone was committed to this project. I learned how important team work is and how much it gets a job done faster and more efficient. It was a great group of people and I'm thankful to have met everyone. 
 - One thing I would have to say that will be transferred to the next hackathon event is calculating how much food to be made for the exact amount of people. We did have leftovers and could have saved some money by not cooking as much food than needed. It was good to not be short on supply though. We ended up not baking the breads or cookies so that could have been something we could've saved money on. I guess this will also be another lesson learned - To not over plan.. I believe all of us were full from the meals, so we really didn't need the bread or cookies! For how much was spent on groceries, we did stay in budget! :smile: I'd have to say the total amount spent, divided by the amount of people, was $20 per person. It's good to know this for future events. 

#Great job to everyone :clap::clap::clap: A big shout out to Evergreen who donated the coffee, Vet Startups for donating the money to buy groceries for the food, and those who came and really put in their all to make this first Hackathon a success! We were all up for 24 hours and got the job done. Very impressive! Until next time :v:
